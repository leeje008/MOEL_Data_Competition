# MOEL_Data_Competition
This repository is utilized for a data competition organized by the Ministry of Employment and Labor

## Environment

- Java must be installed to use the konlp packages (for extracting Korean nouns for word clouds).
- The stopword.txt file contains Korean stop words.
- The requirements.txt file should include all the Python libraries that your notebooks rely on, and these libraries will be installed using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- In some cases, the word cloud for Korean text may appear with corrupted fonts. To resolve this issue, use the NanumGothic.ttf font file from NanumFontSetup_TTF_GOTHIC. For more details, refer to wordcloud_policy.ipynb.
